# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Jan 29 2026: The Python red/black rebalancing lesson was too much for me to complete today and an "easy" challenge was too hard. See if this triggers my "did something today" flag. The first try didn't work but boot.dev also didn't have read access to this repo. That was changed under Settings - Applications. That second try worked.

Feb 1 2026: Almost forgot today. Ugh, that didn't work.

Feb 8 2026: Still stuck on red/black rebalancing.
